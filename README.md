# DJS09: Couch Surfing | Typescript Practice

## Project Overview

For this challenge, we were required to code along with the lecturer from this lesson:  Couch Surfing Website. For this challenge we were required to code along with the lecturer from this lesson: Learn Typescript Tutorial

The focus for this project will be to understand the concepts around a JavaScript superset like Typescript and to get a feel for how it works. We submit the finished Couch Surfing Website as our DJS09 Submission. 

## Discussion and Reflection

### Project Analysis
The project was a simple Couch Surfing Website that allowed users to view the available couches. Its overroll aim is to get us practicing and learning typescript.
- The project was a good way to get us familiar with typescript and its syntax.
- It also helped us understand how to use typescript with react.
- We learned what primitives types are and how to use them in TypeScript
- We learned how to add properties
- We learned about the varies types and how to implement them, such as:
    - object types
    - tuples types
    - array types
    - Enums types
    - Any types
    - Union types
    - Literal types
    - Function types
    - Void types
- We touched on interfaces and file organisation to abstract some of the code logic

### Challenges and Reflections
I can't really say that the project was difficult because we were coding along and not creating anything from scratch. The project's aim was to get our hands dirty with learning TypeScript and it was definetely achieved becease we now have a firm grasp of what type is and what and when we can use it for.
